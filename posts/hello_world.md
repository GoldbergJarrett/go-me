# Hello, World!
<small> 8 March 2025 </small>

If you are reading this, I am genuinely curious how you found it.

Creating a blog is something I have wanted to do for years. I was very inspired by my colleagues and the amazing [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/). This first iteration of my blog style is 100% inspired by Thorsten. I thought if I could make one like his, I could eventually evolve it to be my own. It was challenging. I thought doing this in Go would be fun, and it was! I did learn **very** quickly that I seriously dislike frontend development. I'll probably write a separate post about that.

Ever since I was very young, I knew I wanted to be a programmer. I always knew that creating things was something I wanted to do. I thought it was impossible that the very dream job I had always wanted actually stuck around and never changed. Usually, kids want to be a president, firefighter, police officer, or something like that. Not me. I wanted to be a programmer. I'm extremely grateful that I can say I made it.

So what are my plans with this blog? To be honest, I have no plan. For now and the foreseeable future, I just want to use this as an outlet to write about whatever I want—but mostly technical topics. I am not the best writer either. I plan on using an LLM to correct my spelling and grammar, so don't read too deeply into everything you see here. I do want to use this as an outlet to improve my writing if possible. I would ask for tips, but I don't know how just yet. Surely, I don't just hand out my main email, right? I'd just get spammed by bots. Maybe not?

Now, more about my technical background. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [Southern New Hampshire University](https://degrees.snhu.edu/). I dropped out of [Rutgers](https://www.rutgers.edu/) after getting weeded out by the Discrete Mathematics class. It was embarrassing and remains one of the moments in life I am very disappointed about. I loved Rutgers and the program I was in, but I was unable to stay after failing. Since I was paying for college myself, I decided to attend a more affordable school. So, I finished my degree at Southern New Hampshire University. The people and teachings at Rutgers were amazing. I wish I had never left.

I used a lot of Java while learning to program in community college, then C at Rutgers. C was by far my best language. After transferring to Southern New Hampshire University, I learned Python. Python has since become my most-used language. I now use Python professionally at work, mostly for developing applications with the Django framework. It's quite nice. On the side, I have picked up a few other languages. I worked with Go for a little while, and I plan on learning Rust soon. I expect to write a blog on both Go and Rust eventually. Maybe after completing a bigger project in Go, I'll write about my experience using it. I was thinking of working through Thorsten Ball’s book on interpreters and compilers.

That is all for now. In honor of Thorsten Ball himself, I will leave you all with links to a few things I have been reading.

  This is just wonderful. I was very much behind on this knowledge, and I am glad a colleague showed me this! It's a quick read, and I highly recommend it.

- [We, Programmers](https://www.amazon.com/We-Programmers-Chronicle-Coders-Robert/dp/0135344263)  
  Although I don't like clean coding, and my experience with Agile hasn't been great, I still very much respect Uncle Bob. This book has been very good so far. I am not too far into it yet, so I won't recommend it outright, but look out for a future comment on this book!
